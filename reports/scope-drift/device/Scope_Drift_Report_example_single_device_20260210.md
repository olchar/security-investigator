## Executive Summary

**contoso-vd-0.contoso.com** is a Windows 11 workstation operating on a predictable Mon–Fri corporate schedule. The device shows **no scope expansion** and **no suspicious behavioral changes** in the recent 7-day window compared to its 90-day baseline.

**Drift Score: 65.4%** — below the 100% baseline threshold. The sub-100% score is expected: cumulative diversity metrics (distinct processes, chains) naturally accumulate fewer unique values over 7 days vs 90 days. When normalized to daily averages, process execution volume is **stable at 110.4%** of baseline.

Key findings:
- 🟢 All 34 first-seen processes are **Microsoft update artifacts** (Defender definition patches, Edge updates, Office deployment tools)
- 🟢 All 30 new process chains are **SYSTEM-account update operations**
- 🟢 Zero new signing companies — identical software publisher landscape
- 🟢 Zero notable command-line patterns (no recon, lateral movement, persistence, or exfiltration)
- 🟢 7 historical security incidents — all **BenignPositive / Closed** (RDP analytics rules)
- 🔵 `jsmith` user account absent from recent 7-day window (only system/service accounts active)
- 🟢 Heartbeat pattern fully consistent with established Mon–Fri schedule

### Dimension Breakdown

| # | Dimension | Weight | Baseline (90d) | Recent (7d) | Ratio | Weighted | Status |
|---|-----------|--------|----------------|-------------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Volume** (daily avg) | 0.30 | 647.6 /day | 714.9 /day | 110.4% | 33.12 | 🟢 Stable |
| 2 | **Processes** (distinct) | 0.25 | 545 | 168 | 30.8% | 7.70 | 🔵 Expected¹ |
| 3 | **Accounts** (distinct) | 0.15 | 6 | 3 | 50.0% | 7.50 | 🟡 Notable² |
| 4 | **Chains** (distinct) | 0.20 | 725 | 258 | 35.6% | 7.12 | 🔵 Expected¹ |

| | | | | | **Total** | **65.44** | |

> ¹ **Expected contraction:** Cumulative distinct counts over 7 days cannot match 90-day accumulation. Per-day unique process counts are consistent (recent: ~105–126/day vs baseline: ~100–120/day).
>
> ² **Notable:** 3 accounts dropped from recent window (`jsmith`, `umfd-2`, `dwm-2`). See [Account Landscape](#account-landscape) for analysis.

## First-Seen Processes (Recent Window)

**Count: 34** — ✅ All are Microsoft update artifacts. No suspicious first-seen processes.

Every first-seen process in the recent 7-day window is a **version-stamped Microsoft binary** that gets a unique filename per release cycle. This is a known false-positive pattern documented in the SKILL.md pitfalls section.

| Category | Count | Examples | Account | Assessment |
|----------|-------|----------|---------|------------|
| 📦 **Defender Definition Patches** | ~20 | `AM_Delta_Patch_1.1.25010.7.exe`, `AM_Delta_Patch_1.1.25020.3.exe`, ... | SYSTEM | 🟢 Expected — daily antimalware definition updates |
| 📦 **Edge Browser Updates** | ~5 | `MicrosoftEdge_X64_133.0.3065.39.exe`, `MicrosoftEdge_X64_133.0.3065.51.exe`, ... | SYSTEM | 🟢 Expected — browser auto-update channel |
| 📦 **Office Deployment Tool** | ~5 | `odtxxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.tmp.exe`, ... | SYSTEM | 🟢 Expected — Office Click-to-Run temp binaries |
| 📦 **Security Health Setup** | ~2 | `SecurityHealthSetup.exe` variants | SYSTEM | 🟢 Expected — Windows Security component update |
| 📦 **Other Microsoft Updates** | ~2 | `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe`, `setup.exe` | SYSTEM | 🟢 Expected — update infrastructure |

> **Why these appear as "first-seen":** Each Defender definition patch, Edge update, and Office deployment temp file contains a version number or GUID in the filename, making every release a unique process name. The underlying behavior is identical — only the version stamp changes.

---

## New Process Chains (Recent Window)

**Count: 30** — ✅ All are SYSTEM-account update operations. No suspicious chains.

All 30 new process chains follow the same pattern: `svchost.exe → [update component] → [versioned binary]`, executed under the SYSTEM account via Windows Update, Defender updates, or Office servicing.

| Chain Pattern | Count | Account | Assessment |
|---------------|-------|---------|------------|
| `svchost.exe → MpSigStub.exe → AM_Delta_Patch_*.exe` | ~15 | SYSTEM | 🟢 Defender definition update chain |
| `svchost.exe → MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe → MicrosoftEdge_X64_*.exe` | ~5 | SYSTEM | 🟢 Edge browser update chain |
| `svchost.exe → OfficeClickToRun.exe → odt*.tmp.exe` | ~5 | SYSTEM | 🟢 Office servicing chain |
| `svchost.exe → SecurityHealthSetup.exe` | ~2 | SYSTEM | 🟢 Windows Security update |
| `svchost.exe → MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe → setup.exe` | ~3 | SYSTEM | 🟢 Edge updater bootstrap |

> No chains involving interactive user accounts, unknown parent processes, or suspicious execution patterns (encoded commands, download cradles, LOLBIN abuse).

## Security Alerts & Incidents

**Total incidents involving this device (90d + 7d): 7**
**Recent window (7d): 0**
**All 7 incidents: BenignPositive / Closed** ✅

| # | Incident | Title | Severity | Classification | Status | Date | Tactics |
|---|----------|-------|----------|----------------|--------|------|---------|
| 1 | #1067 | Rare RDP Connections | High | BenignPositive | Closed | 2026-01-27 | LateralMovement (T1021) |
| 2 | #1062 | RDP Nesting | Medium | BenignPositive | Closed | 2026-01-26 | LateralMovement (T1021) |
| 3 | #1035 | Rare RDP Connections | Medium | BenignPositive | Closed | 2026-01-06 | LateralMovement (T1021) |
| 4 | #1010 | RDP Nesting | Low | BenignPositive | Closed | 2025-12-08 | LateralMovement (T1021) |
| 5 | #1009 | Rare RDP Connections | Low | BenignPositive | Closed | 2025-12-08 | LateralMovement (T1021) |
| 6 | #998 | RDP Nesting | High | BenignPositive | Closed | 2025-11-29 | LateralMovement (T1021) |
| 7 | #997 | Rare RDP Connections | High | BenignPositive | Closed | 2025-11-29 | LateralMovement (T1021) |

**Analysis:**
- 🟢 All incidents are **RDP analytics rule** detections from Microsoft Sentinel (Scheduled Alerts)
- 🟢 All classified **BenignPositive** — reviewed and determined to be legitimate RDP activity
- 🟢 Incidents appear in pairs ("Rare RDP Connections" + "RDP Nesting") on same/adjacent dates — consistent with lab RDP patterns
- 🟢 **No incidents in the recent 7-day window** — last incident was Jan 27, 2026
- 🔵 Pattern is recurring (~biweekly), suggesting a scheduled task or regular admin RDP session triggering the analytics

---

## New Signing Companies

**Count: 0** — ✅ No new signing companies appeared in the recent window.

All 8 signing companies present in the recent window match the baseline exactly. The software publisher landscape is unchanged.

---

## Notable Command-Line Patterns

**Count: 0** — ✅ No reconnaissance, lateral movement, persistence, or exfiltration patterns detected.

The query scanned for:
- Reconnaissance: `whoami`, `ipconfig`, `net user`, `nltest`, `systeminfo`, `qwinsta`
- Lateral movement: `PsExec`, `wmic /node`, `Enter-PSSession`
- Persistence: `schtasks /create`, `reg add.*Run`, `New-Service`
- Exfiltration: `Invoke-WebRequest`, `curl`, `certutil -urlcache`, base64 encoded commands

None were found in the recent 7-day window.

## Account Landscape

### Baseline vs Recent Comparison

| Account | Baseline Events | Baseline Processes | Recent Events | Recent Processes | Status |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| **system** | 49,818 | 481 | 4,405 | 156 | 🟢 Active — primary account |
| **local service** | 4,321 | 16 | 324 | 14 | 🟢 Active — consistent |
| **network service** | 3,083 | 10 | 265 | 10 | 🟢 Active — consistent |
| **jsmith** | 1,062 | 66 | — | — | 🟡 Absent from recent |
| **umfd-2** | 6 | 1 | — | — | 🔵 Absent (RDP session artifact) |
| **dwm-2** | 6 | 1 | — | — | 🔵 Absent (RDP session artifact) |

### Analysis

- 🟢 **Core service accounts stable:** `system`, `local service`, and `network service` maintain consistent process diversity between baseline and recent windows
- 🟡 **`jsmith` inactive:** This interactive user account had 1,062 process events (66 distinct processes) during the baseline but zero activity in the recent 7 days. This indicates the workstation is running unattended — only system-level processes are executing. Possible explanations: vacation, work-from-home, or using a different workstation. **Not a security concern** — the absence of user activity does not indicate compromise
- 🔵 **`umfd-2` and `dwm-2` absent:** These are Windows Desktop Window Manager and User Mode Font Driver accounts associated with RDP sessions (session ID 2). Their absence in recent confirms no RDP sessions in the last 7 days, which aligns with the absence of `jsmith`

## Daily Process Volume (Per-Session Analysis)

### Recent Period Daily Breakdown

| Date | Day | Events | Unique Processes | Accounts | Assessment |
|------|-----|--------|-----------------|----------|------------|
| Feb 3 | Tue | 957 | 118 | 3 | 🟢 Normal |
| Feb 4 | Wed | 968 | 120 | 3 | 🟢 Normal |
| Feb 5 | Thu | 999 | 123 | 3 | 🟢 Normal |
| Feb 6 | Fri | 1,000 | 126 | 3 | 🟢 Normal |
| Feb 7 | Sat | 167 | 43 | 3 | 🟢 Normal (abbreviated) |
| Feb 9 | Mon | 906 | 119 | 3 | 🟢 Normal |
| Feb 10 | Tue | 514 | 105 | 3 | 🟢 Partial day (in progress) |

### Baseline Context

| Metric | Baseline Weekday Avg | Recent Weekday Avg | Trend |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Events/day | ~830–950 | ~957–1,000 | 🟢 Slight increase, within normal band |
| Unique processes/day | ~100–120 | ~118–126 | 🟢 Consistent |
| Accounts/day | 3 (typical), 6 (update days) | 3 | 🟢 Consistent |

### Baseline Notable Spikes

Several baseline days showed elevated activity (1,000–1,650 events with 6 accounts and 160–185 processes). These correspond to **scheduled update deployments** and are not anomalies:

| Date | Events | Processes | Accounts | Explanation |
|------|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Nov 18 | 1,651 | 182 | 6 | Update deployment day |
| Nov 28 | 1,040 | 164 | 6 | Update deployment day |
| Dec 8 | 1,364 | 185 | 6 | Update deployment day |
| Jan 6 | 1,044 | 160 | 6 | Update deployment day |
| Jan 13 | 1,070 | 164 | 6 | Update deployment day |
| Jan 26 | 1,263 | 184 | 6 | Update deployment day |

> These update days show a **biweekly pattern** and involve 6 accounts (adding `jsmith`, `umfd-2`, `dwm-2` to the standard 3). The elevated activity is consistent with Windows Update + Defender definition + Office servicing happening in a maintenance window.

## Methodology

### Drift Score Formula

$$\text{DriftScore} = 0.30 \times V + 0.25 \times P + 0.15 \times A + 0.20 \times C + 0.10 \times S$$

Where:
- **V** = Volume ratio (recent daily avg / baseline daily avg × 100)
- **P** = Process ratio (recent distinct / baseline distinct × 100)
- **A** = Account ratio (recent distinct / baseline distinct × 100)
- **C** = Chain ratio (recent distinct / baseline distinct × 100)
- **S** = Company ratio (recent distinct / baseline distinct × 100)

### Score Interpretation

| Range | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|
| < 80% | Contracting scope — **STABLE** (sub-100% is expected for short recent windows) |
| 80–120% | Baseline-consistent — **STABLE** |
| 120–200% | Moderate expansion — **REVIEW** recommended |
| > 200% | Significant expansion — **INVESTIGATE** immediately |

### Data Sources Queried

| Query | Source | Purpose | Result |
|-------|--------|---------|--------|
| Q14 | Data Lake — DeviceProcessEvents | Daily summary (volume, processes, accounts) | 79 days of data |
| Q15 | Data Lake — DeviceProcessEvents | Baseline vs recent totals | BL: 58,286 events / RC: 5,004 events |
| Q16 | Data Lake — DeviceProcessEvents | First-seen processes in recent window | 34 (all Microsoft updates) |
| Q17 | Data Lake — DeviceProcessEvents | New process chains in recent window | 30 (all SYSTEM update chains) |
| Q18 | Data Lake — SecurityAlert + SecurityIncident | Correlated alerts/incidents for this device | 7 incidents (all BenignPositive) |
| Q19 | Data Lake — DeviceProcessEvents | New signing companies in recent window | 0 |
| Q20 | Data Lake — DeviceProcessEvents | Notable command-line patterns | 0 |
| Q21 | Data Lake — Heartbeat | Daily uptime/power schedule | 79 active days, consistent pattern |
| Q22 | Data Lake — DeviceProcessEvents | Per-session daily volume breakdown | Consistent weekday volume |

### Known Pitfalls Applied

| Pitfall | How Addressed |
|---------|---------------|
| **Version-stamped process names** | Identified all 34 first-seen processes as versioned Microsoft update binaries — not true "new" processes |
| **Cumulative distinct count bias** | Noted that P (30.8%) and C (35.6%) ratios reflect 7d vs 90d accumulation window, not actual contraction. Per-day diversity is consistent |
| **Weekend/off-hours bias** | Saturday and Sunday patterns factored into daily average calculations via Heartbeat corroboration |
| **SecurityAlert.Status immutability** | Joined SecurityAlert with SecurityIncident to get true investigation status (all Closed/BenignPositive) |
