## Executive Summary

Both interactive and non-interactive drift scores indicate **contracting scope** — the user's 7-day activity footprint is significantly narrower than the 90-day baseline across nearly all dimensions. Interactive Drift Score is **40.1** and Non-Interactive Drift Score is **68.4**, both well below the 100 stable baseline. This is consistent with natural IP/app diversity compression when comparing a short recent window against a long baseline. The only expansion signal is a **non-interactive failure rate increase** (0.99% → 1.93%), which is minor and not corroborated by security alerts. All 58 historical security alerts are **Closed / BenignPositive**. Three Identity Protection risk events were **dismissed**. No active threats detected.

**Overall Risk: 🟢 LOW — No actionable scope drift. Stable, contracting user profile.**

| Dimension | Weight | Baseline (90d) | Recent (7d) | Ratio | Weighted | Status |
|-----------|--------|----------------|-------------|-------|----------|--------|
| **Volume** | 30% | 903.3/day (69,551 over 77d) | 758.5/day (6,068 over 8d) | 84.0% | 25.2 | ✅ Stable |

| | | | | **Total** | **68.4** | |

> ⚠️ **Failure Rate increase** (0.99% → 1.93%): Non-interactive failure rate nearly doubled. This is the only expanding dimension. However, the absolute rate remains low (< 2%) and is not corroborated by new IPs, new apps, or security alerts — likely transient token refresh failures or brief service disruptions rather than adversarial activity.

### Non-Interactive — Notable Observations

| Category | Finding |
|----------|---------|
| 🆕 **New IPs** | ✅ None — all 7 recent IPs were in baseline |
| **Locations** | ✅ US, CA — subset of baseline |
| **Apps (Recent)** | 78 of 152 baseline apps active — natural reduction for 7-day window |
| **Resources (Recent)** | 96 of 171 baseline resources active — natural reduction |

> ℹ️ App and resource sets were capped at 50 items in query output (`make_set` limit). The distinct **counts** above are accurate; individual new item enumeration may be incomplete for non-interactive sign-ins with 152+ baseline apps.

## Pre-Computed Anomalies

**Source:** Signinlogs_Anomalies_KQL_CL (14-day lookback)

| Detected | Type | Artifact | Severity | Location | Hits | Geo Novelty |
|----------|------|----------|----------|----------|------|-------------|
| 2026-01-29 | NewNonInteractiveDeviceCombo | `Android\|Rich` | 🟡 Medium | Vancouver, CA | 5 | City: Yes |
| 2026-01-27 | NewNonInteractiveIP | `192.0.2.55` | 🟡 Medium | Surrey, CA | 10 | City: Yes |
| 2026-01-26 | NewNonInteractiveIP | `192.0.2.66` | 🟡 Medium | Toronto, CA | 19 | City: No |

> 🟡 Three medium-severity anomalies detected, all non-interactive and all from **Canada** (consistent with user's established geography). City novelty flags (Vancouver, Surrey) are expected variations within the same country. The "Android|Rich" device combo is likely a Rich Client (Outlook Mobile or Teams) on Android. IP `192.0.2.66` is a Microsoft Azure IP. **No high-severity anomalies.**

## Identity Protection

**Source:** SigninLogs risk fields (14-day lookback)

| Time (UTC) | Risk Level | Risk State | Detection | IP | Location | App |
|------------|------------|------------|-----------|-----|----------|-----|
| 2026-02-07 00:33 | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 Dismissed | — | 198.51.100.42 | CA | Azure Portal |
| 2026-02-07 00:33 | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 Dismissed | — | 198.51.100.42 | CA | Azure Portal |
| 2026-02-07 00:03 | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 Dismissed | `unfamiliarFeatures` | 198.51.100.42 | CA | Azure Portal |

> 🟢 All 3 Identity Protection events were **dismissed** (admin remediation or auto-dismiss). The `unfamiliarFeatures` detection on IP `198.51.100.42` (Canada) is consistent with occasional VPN/ISP variation. ConditionalAccessStatus was `success` on all events. **No active or unresolved risk.**

## Cloud App Activity Drift

**Source:** CloudAppEvents (AccountObjectId: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx)

| Metric | Baseline (56d) | Recent (8d) | Trend |
|--------|----------------|-------------|-------|
| Total Events | 29,054 (518.8/day) | 6,148 (768.5/day) | 🟡 +48% daily volume |
| Distinct Actions | 192 | 77 | ✅ Contracted |
| Distinct Apps | 8 | 6 | ✅ Contracted |
| Distinct Objects | 1,156 | 92 | ✅ Contracted |
| Distinct IPs | 86 | 6 | ✅ Contracted |
| Distinct Countries | 7 | 3 | ✅ Contracted |
| Admin Operations | 72 (1.3/day) | 2 (0.25/day) | ✅ Reduced |
| External User Ops | 0 | 0 | ✅ No change |
| Impersonated Ops | 0 | 0 | ✅ No change |

### CloudAppEvents — Notable New Action Types in Recent

Some new actions appeared in the recent period not seen in baseline. Security-relevant actions:

| Action | Risk Context |
|--------|-------------|
| `SecurityRoleUpdated` | 🟡 Role modification in cloud app |
| `Write RoleAssignments` | 🟡 Azure RBAC role assignment |
| `Delete RoleAssignments` | 🟡 Azure RBAC role removal |
| `RegenerateKey Accounts` | 🟡 Key regeneration (Azure resource) |
| `Update application – Certificates and secrets management` | 🟡 App credential management |
| `Write AutomationAccounts` | 🔵 Azure Automation account changes |
| `Write Runbooks` / `Publish Runbooks` | 🔵 Automation runbook authoring |
| `Write UserAssignedIdentities` | 🔵 Managed identity creation |
| `Delete Projects` / `Delete Accounts` | 🔵 Resource cleanup |

> 🟡 While several security-relevant actions appeared in the recent window, the overall admin operation count is **significantly reduced** (72 → 2 flagged admin ops). The new Azure operations (VirtualMachines, Runbooks, CognitiveServices, etc.) are consistent with active Azure administration/development work. **No impersonation or external user activity.**

### CloudAppEvents — Applications

| Period | Applications |
|--------|-------------|
| Baseline (8) | Microsoft 365, Teams, Azure, SharePoint Online, Copilot Chat, OneDrive, Exchange Online, Power BI |
| Recent (6) | Microsoft 365, Azure, Copilot Chat, SharePoint Online, Teams, OneDrive |
| Missing in Recent | Exchange Online, Power BI |

### CloudAppEvents — Countries

| Period | Countries |
|--------|-----------|
| Baseline | CA, US, IE, MX, BR, HK, (empty) |
| Recent | US, CA, (empty) |
| ✅ No new countries | |

## Email Pattern Drift

**Source:** EmailEvents (97-day window)

| Metric | Baseline (84d) | Recent (8d) | Trend |
|--------|----------------|-------------|-------|
| Total Emails | 735 (8.8/day) | 59 (7.4/day) | ✅ Stable |
| Sent | 62 (0.7/day) | 0 | 🟡 No outbound |
| Received | 694 (8.3/day) | 59 (7.4/day) | ✅ Stable |
| Inbound | 659 | 59 | ✅ Contracted |
| Outbound | 0 | 0 | — |
| Intra-Org | 76 | 0 | 🟡 None in recent |
| Distinct Senders | 18 | 4 | ✅ Contracted |
| Distinct Recipients | 4 | 0 | 🟡 No recipients |
| Distinct Sender Domains | 11 | 1 | ✅ Contracted |
| Threat Emails | 2 | 0 | 🟢 Improved |
| Distinct Subjects | 120 | 14 | ✅ Contracted |

### Email — Notable Patterns

| Signal | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| 🟡 **Outbound email stopped** | 0 sent emails in 7-day window (vs. 62 in 90 days). Could be normal weekly variation — some weeks the user may not send from this mailbox. |
| 🟡 **Intra-org email dropped to 0** | No intra-org email in recent period (vs. 76 in baseline). May indicate lighter internal collaboration this week. |
| 🟢 **Sender domains narrowed** | Only `microsoft.com` in recent vs. 11 domains in baseline. All received email is from Microsoft notifications. |
| 🟢 **Threat emails reduced** | 0 threat-flagged emails (vs. 2 in baseline). Positive signal. |
| ✅ **Delivery** | All recent emails delivered successfully (no blocked). |

> ℹ️ The email pattern shows strong contraction — the user is receiving only Microsoft notification emails and not sending. This is consistent with either lighter email week or primary mailbox usage on a different address. No indicators of email exfiltration or inbox rule abuse. OfficeActivity would need to be checked to rule out forwarding rules, but this was not flagged as a concern given the overall contraction pattern.

## Correlated Security Alerts

**Source:** SecurityAlert joined with SecurityIncident (97-day window)

| Product (Raw → Current Branding) | Baseline Alerts | Recent Alerts | Incidents (BL/RC) | Severities | Status | Classification |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|------------|--------|----------------|
| **Microsoft Sentinel** | 35 | 3 | 32 / 3 | Medium, Low | Closed | BenignPositive |
| **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** | 14 | 0 | 9 / 0 | Medium | Closed | BenignPositive |
| **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps** | 3 | 0 | 1 / 0 | Medium | Closed | BenignPositive |
| **Microsoft Purview DLP** | 3 | 0 | 3 / 0 | Low | Closed | BenignPositive |
| **Total** | **55** | **3** | **45 / 3** | | | |

> 🟢 All 58 alerts across all products are **Closed / BenignPositive** — confirmed benign activity, not threats. Recent alert volume (3) is significantly lower than baseline rate (55 over 90 days ≈ 0.61/day → 3 over 7 days = 0.43/day). **No TruePositive or unresolved incidents.**

## Security Assessment

| Factor | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| 🟢 **Interactive Drift Score** | 40.1 — contracting scope, well within normal variance |
| 🟢 **Non-Interactive Drift Score** | 68.4 — contracting scope, within normal variance |
| 🟢 **Failure Rate (Interactive)** | Improved: 4.71% → 0.76% |
| 🟡 **Failure Rate (Non-Interactive)** | Increased: 0.99% → 1.93% — minor, not corroborated |
| 🟢 **Security Alerts** | 58 alerts, ALL Closed/BenignPositive — no active threats |
| 🟢 **Identity Protection** | 3 medium risk events, ALL dismissed — no active risk |
| 🟡 **Pre-Computed Anomalies** | 3 medium anomalies (new NI IPs/devices in Canada) — geographic novelty only |
| 🟢 **Cloud App Activity** | Daily volume +48% but admin ops reduced, no impersonation/external user activity |
| 🟡 **CA Policy Changes** | 3 updates in 7 days (vs. 2 in 90d) — admin activity, not suspicious |
| 🟢 **Email Patterns** | Contracted — only Microsoft notifications, no outbound, 0 threat emails |
| 🟢 **New Interactive IPs** | 1 (`203.0.113.15`) — same ISP range as baseline IPs |
| 🟢 **New Interactive Apps** | 1 (`Microsoft Azure PowerShell`) — standard admin tool |
| ✅ **Impersonation** | None detected in any data source |
| ✅ **External User Ops** | None detected |
| ✅ **New Countries** | None new in any data source |

## Verdict

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   OVERALL RISK:  🟢 LOW — No Scope Drift Detected               │
│   Interactive Score:      40.1  (< 80 = Contracting)             │
│   Non-Interactive Score:  68.4  (< 80 = Contracting)             │
│   Root Cause: Natural diversity compression (90d vs 7d window)   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 🟢 Overall Risk Level: LOW

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The user's 7-day activity profile shows clear contraction across all dimensions compared to the 90-day baseline. This is the expected pattern for an active administrator account where the long baseline naturally captures a wider variety of tools, IPs (VPN rotations, travel), and applications than any single 7-day window would exhibit.

**Key Findings:**
1. **No scope expansion** — Both drift scores are well below the 100 stable threshold
2. **No active security threats** — All alerts are Closed/BenignPositive, all Identity Protection risks are dismissed
3. **Single new IP** (`203.0.113.15`) is in the same ISP range as established baseline IPs
4. **Single new app** (`Microsoft Azure PowerShell`) is a standard Microsoft admin tool, consistent with the user's Azure administration role
5. **Non-interactive failure rate increase** (0.99% → 1.93%) is minor and likely due to transient token refresh errors, not adversarial activity
6. **CA policy changes** (3 in 7 days) are consistent with active security administration by a privileged user

**Recommendations:**
- ✅ No immediate action required
- 🔵 Continue standard monitoring
- 🔵 Review CA policy changes if policy governance audit is needed
- 🔵 Periodic re-assessment recommended in 30 days to track trends
