## Overview

### What is a Honeypot Investigation?

A honeypot investigation is a comprehensive security analysis performed on decoy systems (honeypots) designed to attract and log malicious activity. These investigations provide critical threat intelligence by:

- **Detecting attack patterns** from real-world threat actors
- **Identifying emerging threats** before they target production systems
- **Collecting threat intelligence** (malicious IPs, exploits, TTPs)
- **Validating security controls** and detection capabilities
- **Providing early warning** of campaigns targeting the organization

### Investigation Scope

Each investigation analyzes:

- **Failed authentication attempts** (RDP, SSH, Windows logon)
- **Web exploitation attempts** (SQL injection, XSS, path traversal, CVE-specific exploits)
- **Network reconnaissance** (port scans, connection attempts)
- **Threat intelligence correlation** (known malicious IPs, APT groups)
- **Security incidents** triggered by honeypot activity
- **Vulnerability assessment** of the honeypot system
- **Attack pattern analysis** (MITRE ATT&CK mapping)

---

## Purpose and Objectives

### Primary Objectives

1. **Threat Intelligence Collection**
   - Identify novel malicious IPs not yet cataloged in threat intelligence feeds
   - Document new attack patterns, exploit techniques, and malware signatures
   - Provide actionable indicators of compromise (IOCs) for organizational defense

2. **Attack Pattern Analysis**
   - Understand attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
   - Map observed activities to MITRE ATT&CK framework
   - Assess threat actor sophistication levels

3. **Security Posture Assessment**
   - Evaluate detection rule effectiveness
   - Measure incident response trigger rates
   - Identify gaps in security monitoring coverage

4. **Vulnerability Risk Assessment**
   - Cross-reference honeypot vulnerabilities with observed exploitation attempts
   - Prioritize patching based on active targeting
   - Assess real-world exploit availability for CVEs

### Success Metrics

- **Threat Intelligence Value**: Novel IPs discovered / Total attacking IPs
- **Detection Coverage**: Incidents generated / Total attack events
- **Intelligence Quality**: Threat intel match rate (% of IPs with known malicious indicators)

## Technical Implementation

### Phase 1: Query Failed Connections

**Objective**: Identify all attacking IPs from authentication failures, web exploits, and network reconnaissance.

#### Query 1A: Windows Security Events

**Table**: `SecurityEvent`  
**Event IDs**: 4625 (Failed Logon), 4771 (Kerberos Pre-Auth Failed), 4776 (NTLM Auth Failed)

```kql
let start = datetime(2025-12-12);
let end = datetime(2025-12-14);
let honeypot = 'honeypot-server';

SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated between (start .. end)
| where Computer contains honeypot
| where EventID in (4625, 4771, 4776)
| where isnotempty(IpAddress) and IpAddress != "-"
| where IpAddress != "127.0.0.1"
| summarize 
    FailedAttempts=count(), 
    FirstSeen=min(TimeGenerated), 
    LastSeen=max(TimeGenerated),
    TargetAccounts=make_set(Account, 10)
    by IpAddress, EventID
| extend EventType = case(
    EventID == 4625, "Failed Logon",
    EventID == 4771, "Kerberos Pre-Auth Failed",
    EventID == 4776, "NTLM Auth Failed",
    "Unknown")
| order by FailedAttempts desc
| take 50
```

**What This Captures:**
- RDP brute force attacks (EventID 4625)
- Kerberos authentication failures (EventID 4771)
- NTLM authentication failures (EventID 4776)
- Target usernames attempted by attackers

#### Query 1B: IIS Web Server Logs

**Table**: `W3CIISLog`  
**Focus**: HTTP 4xx/5xx errors indicating exploitation attempts

```kql
let start = datetime(2025-12-12);
let end = datetime(2025-12-14);
let honeypot = 'honeypot-server';

W3CIISLog
| where TimeGenerated between (start .. end)
| where Computer =~ honeypot
| where tolong(scStatus) >= 400
| where cIP != "127.0.0.1" and cIP != "::1"
| summarize 
    RequestCount=count(), 
    FirstSeen=min(TimeGenerated), 
    LastSeen=max(TimeGenerated),
    TargetedURIs=make_set(csUriStem, 10),
    StatusCodes=make_set(tolong(scStatus), 5)
    by IpAddress = cIP
| order by RequestCount desc
| take 50
```

**What This Captures:**
- SQL injection attempts
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) probes
- Path traversal attempts
- CVE-specific exploit payloads (PHPUnit, Struts2, OpenWrt, etc.)
- Web shell upload attempts

#### Query 1C: Network Traffic (Defender)

**Table**: `DeviceNetworkEvents`  
**Focus**: Successful inbound connections to common attack surfaces

```kql
let start = datetime(2025-12-12);
let end = datetime(2025-12-14);
let honeypot = 'honeypot-server';

DeviceNetworkEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (start .. end)
| where DeviceName =~ honeypot
| where ActionType in ("ConnectionSuccess", "InboundConnectionAccepted", "ConnectionFound")
| where LocalPort in (3389, 80, 443, 445, 22, 21, 23, 8080, 8443)
| where RemoteIP != "127.0.0.1" and RemoteIP != "::1" and RemoteIP != "::ffff:127.0.0.1"
| where RemoteIP !startswith "192.168." and RemoteIP !startswith "10." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.16."
| where RemoteIP !startswith "fe80:" and RemoteIP !startswith "fc00:" and RemoteIP !startswith "fd00:"
| where RemoteIP !startswith "::ffff:"
| summarize 
    ConnectionCount=count(), 
    FirstSeen=min(TimeGenerated), 
    LastSeen=max(TimeGenerated),
    TargetedPorts=make_set(LocalPort, 10),
    Actions=make_set(ActionType, 5)
    by RemoteIP
| order by ConnectionCount desc
| take 50
```

**What This Captures:**
- Port scanning activity
- Successful TCP connections to honeypot services
- Multi-port reconnaissance patterns
- C2 communication attempts

#### IP Prioritization Strategy

After collecting all three result sets:

1. **Rank IPs by attack severity:**
   - SecurityEvent FailedAttempts (highest priority)
   - W3CIISLog RequestCount (web exploitation)
   - DeviceNetworkEvents ConnectionCount (reconnaissance)

2. **Select top 10-15 IPs for enrichment** (reduces API costs while maintaining intelligence value)

3. **Save to temporary file:**
   ```json
   {
     "ips": ["203.0.113.42", "198.51.100.10", "192.0.2.50", ...]
   }
   ```

4. **Document total unique attacker count** separately for report statistics

### Phase 2: IP Enrichment & Threat Intelligence

#### IP Enrichment Script

**Script**: `enrich_ips.py`  
**Input**: `temp/honeypot_ips_<timestamp>.json`  
**Output**: Enriched IP data with geolocation, VPN detection, abuse scores

**Command:**
```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "C:\path\to\security-investigator"
cd "C:\path\to\security-investigator"
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe enrich_ips.py --file temp/honeypot_ips_20251214_103245.json
```

**Enrichment Data Collected:**

| Field | Source | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `ip` | Input | IP address |
| `city`, `region`, `country` | ipinfo.io | Geolocation |
| `org`, `asn` | ipinfo.io | Network ownership |
| `is_vpn`, `is_proxy`, `is_tor` | ipinfo.io + vpnapi.io | Anonymization detection |
| `abuse_confidence_score` | AbuseIPDB | Reputation (0-100) |
| `total_reports` | AbuseIPDB | Community reports |
| `threat_description` | Sentinel ThreatIntelIndicators | Threat intel match |

#### Sentinel Threat Intelligence Query

**Table**: `ThreatIntelIndicators`  
**Objective**: Cross-reference attacking IPs with known threat intelligence

```kql
let target_ips = dynamic(["203.0.113.42", "198.51.100.10", "192.0.2.50"]);

ThreatIntelIndicators
| extend IndicatorType = replace_string(replace_string(replace_string(tostring(split(ObservableKey, ":", 0)), "[", ""), "]", ""), "\"", "")
| where IndicatorType in ("ipv4-addr", "ipv6-addr", "network-traffic")
| extend NetworkSourceIP = toupper(ObservableValue)
| where NetworkSourceIP in (target_ips)
| where IsActive and (ValidUntil > now() or isempty(ValidUntil))
| extend Description = tostring(parse_json(Data).description)
| where Description !contains_cs "State: inactive;" and Description !contains_cs "State: falsepos;"
| extend TrafficLightProtocolLevel = tostring(parse_json(AdditionalFields).TLPLevel)
| extend ActivityGroupNames = extract(@"ActivityGroup:(\S+)", 1, tostring(parse_json(Data).labels))
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by NetworkSourceIP
| project 
    TimeGenerated,
    IPAddress = NetworkSourceIP,
    ThreatDescription = Description,
    ActivityGroupNames,
    Confidence,
    ValidUntil,
    TrafficLightProtocolLevel,
    IsActive
| order by Confidence desc, TimeGenerated desc
```

**Threat Intelligence Sources:**
- Microsoft Threat Intelligence (MSTIC)
- STIX/TAXII feeds
- Community threat intel platforms
- Internal organizational indicators

---

### Phase 3: Security Incidents

**Objective**: Identify security incidents triggered by honeypot activity.

#### Step 3A: Get Device ID

```kql
let honeypot = 'honeypot-server';

DeviceInfo
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where DeviceName =~ honeypot or DeviceName contains honeypot
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *)
| project DeviceId, DeviceName, OSPlatform, OSVersion, PublicIP
```

#### Step 3B: Query Security Incidents

```kql
let targetDevice = "honeypot-server";
let targetDeviceId = "<DEVICE_ID_FROM_STEP_3A>";
let start = datetime(2025-12-12);
let end = datetime(2025-12-14);

let relevantAlerts = SecurityAlert
| where TimeGenerated between (start .. end)
| where Entities has targetDevice or Entities has targetDeviceId
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by SystemAlertId
| project SystemAlertId, AlertName, AlertSeverity, ProviderName, Tactics;

SecurityIncident
| where CreatedTime between (start .. end)
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by ProviderIncidentId
| project ProviderIncidentId, Title, Severity, Status, Classification, CreatedTime, LastModifiedTime, Owner, AdditionalData, AlertIds, Labels
| where not(tostring(Labels) has "Redirected")
| mv-expand AlertId = AlertIds
| extend AlertId = tostring(AlertId)
| join kind=inner relevantAlerts on $left.AlertId == $right.SystemAlertId
| extend ProviderIncidentUrl = tostring(AdditionalData.providerIncidentUrl)
| extend OwnerUPN = tostring(Owner.userPrincipalName)
| extend LastModifiedTime = todatetime(LastModifiedTime)
| summarize 
    Title = any(Title),
    Severity = any(Severity),
    Status = any(Status),
    Classification = any(Classification),
    CreatedTime = any(CreatedTime),
    LastModifiedTime = any(LastModifiedTime),
    OwnerUPN = any(OwnerUPN),
    ProviderIncidentUrl = any(ProviderIncidentUrl),
    AlertCount = count(),
    MitreTactics = make_set(Tactics)
    by ProviderIncidentId
| order by LastModifiedTime desc
| take 10
```

**Incident Filtering Logic:**

Only report as threats:
- Status = "New" or "Active"
- Classification NOT "BenignPositive"

Closed incidents with Classification = "BenignPositive" represent **expected honeypot activity** (not security threats).

---

### Phase 4: Vulnerability Assessment

**Objective**: Assess honeypot vulnerabilities and cross-reference with observed exploitation attempts.

#### Step 4A: Activate Advanced Hunting Tools

```python
activate_advanced_hunting_tools()
```

#### Step 4B: Get MDE Machine ID

**CRITICAL**: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint uses a different machine ID format (GUID) than Sentinel's DeviceId (SHA1 hash).

```kql
DeviceInfo 
| where DeviceName =~ 'honeypot-server' 
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) 
| project DeviceId, DeviceName, OSPlatform, OSVersion, PublicIP
```

Extract the **GUID-format DeviceId** from this result.

#### Step 4C: Activate Security Alert Tools

```python
activate_security_alert_and_incident_management_tools()
```

#### Step 4D: Query Vulnerabilities

```python
mcp_sentinel-tria_GetDefenderMachineVulnerabilities({"id": "<MDE_MACHINE_ID>"})
```

**Vulnerability Data Collected:**
- CVE ID
- Severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- CVSS Score
- Affected Product/Component
- Exploit Availability (public exploit exists?)
- Publicly Disclosed (yes/no)

## Best Practices

### Investigation Execution

1. **Always Calculate Date Ranges Correctly**
   - Use current date from context
   - Apply +2 day rule for real-time searches
   - Example: Current = Dec 14, Last 48 hours = Dec 12 to Dec 16

2. **Parallel Query Execution**
   - Run all independent queries simultaneously
   - Reduces investigation time from 3+ minutes to ~60 seconds
   - Phase 1 queries (SecurityEvent, W3CIISLog, DeviceNetworkEvents) can run in parallel

3. **IP Prioritization**
   - Don't enrich all IPs (reduces API costs and token consumption)
   - Select top 10-15 by attack volume
   - Document total count separately for statistics

4. **Time Tracking**
   - Report elapsed time after EVERY phase (mandatory)
   - Use actual timestamps from tool outputs
   - Provide comprehensive timeline at completion

5. **Token Management**
   - Use `create_file` tool for all output (NEVER echo content in chat)
   - Save intermediate results to temp/ for debugging
   - Avoid including large datasets in responses

### Report Quality

1. **Quantitative Analysis**
   - Always include specific counts and percentages
   - Example: "78% of prioritized IPs (12 of 15)" not "most IPs"

2. **CVE References**
   - Cite specific CVE IDs with product names
   - Example: "PHPUnit RCE (CVE-2017-9841)" not "PHPUnit vulnerability"

3. **Risk Assessment**
   - Use enrichment data for context (VPN, abuse scores, threat intel)
   - Don't assume VPN = malicious (check abuse confidence score)

4. **Incident Classification**
   - Distinguish between active threats and benign honeypot activity
   - Status="Closed" + Classification="BenignPositive" = Expected behavior

5. **Actionable Recommendations**
   - Prioritize based on active exploitation attempts
   - Include specific incident numbers, CVE IDs, IP addresses
   - Provide 3 tiers: Immediate (0-24h), Short-Term (1-7d), Long-Term (1-4wk)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **No results from SecurityEvent** | Device not sending Windows Security logs | Verify log forwarding configuration; check EventHub connectivity |
| **Missing honeypot in DeviceInfo** | Device name mismatch | Try `contains` instead of `=~`; check Defender enrollment status |
| **W3CIISLog table not found** | IIS logging not enabled | Enable IIS logging; verify ingestion to Sentinel |
| **IP enrichment script fails** | Missing API token or network issues | Check `config.json` for ipinfo token; verify internet connectivity |
| **Date range returns empty results** | Incorrect date calculation | Verify current date from context; apply +2 day rule correctly |
| **KQL query timeout** | Query too broad or table too large | Reduce `take` limit; narrow time range; add early filters |
| **MDE Machine ID not found** | Using wrong DeviceId format | Use Advanced Hunting to get GUID-format MDE ID (not Sentinel SHA1 hash) |

### Validation Checklist

Before delivering report, verify:

- ✅ All phase timestamps reported to user
- ✅ Total elapsed time calculated and displayed
- ✅ IP enrichment data merged with attack logs
- ✅ Incident filtering correctly applied (only honeypot-related)
- ✅ Vulnerability data retrieved (or documented as unavailable)
- ✅ Report saved to: `reports/Honeypot_Executive_Report_<hostname>_<timestamp>.md`
- ✅ Absolute file path returned to user
- ✅ CVE references include product names
- ✅ Quantitative metrics throughout (not vague statements)
- ✅ MITRE ATT&CK techniques cited with evidence

### Error Messages

| Error | Meaning | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable` | Missing expected field in API response | Add null checks; use default values |
| `SemanticError: Failed to resolve column 'IpAddress'` | Field name typo or wrong table | Verify field exists with `| take 1` query first |
| `ipinfo.io API error 429` | Rate limit exceeded | Add delays between requests; reduce batch size |
| `Device not found in DeviceInfo` | Stale device record | Extend time range: `TimeGenerated > ago(90d)` |
