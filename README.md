**Query Library (`queries/`):**

The `queries/` folder contains **verified, battle-tested KQL query collections** organized by detection scenario. These are the **Priority 2 lookup source** in the [KQL Pre-Flight Checklist](.github/copilot-instructions.md) — Copilot searches them before writing any ad-hoc KQL.

Each file uses a standardized metadata header for efficient `grep_search` discovery:
```markdown
# <Title>
**Tables:** <exact KQL table names>
**Keywords:** <searchable terms — attack techniques, scenarios, field names>
**MITRE:** <ATT&CK technique IDs, e.g., T1021.001, TA0008>
```

To find relevant queries, search by table name or keyword:
```
grep_search("EmailEvents", includePattern: "queries/**")
grep_search("lateral movement", includePattern: "queries/**")
```

#### Additional Prerequisites

6. **Microsoft Sentinel Workspace** with Log Analytics access
7. **Python 3.8+** with virtual environment
8. **GitHub Copilot** (recommended for natural language investigation triggers)

### Setup Steps

#### 1. Install Dependencies

```powershell
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # PowerShell
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat     # CMD

# Install packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**MCP Apps Setup (for visualization and automation skills):**

> ⚠️ **VS Code Insiders Required:** MCP Apps currently require [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) to function. This feature will be available in the stable VS Code release soon, but for now, calling MCP Apps from the standard VS Code version is not supported.

```bash
# Build MCP Apps
cd mcp-apps/sentinel-geomap-server
npm install && npm run build
cd ../sentinel-heatmap-server
npm install && npm run build
cd ../sentinel-incident-comment
npm install && npm run build
cd ../..
```

**Sentinel Incident Comment (Additional Setup Required):**

The `sentinel-incident-comment` MCP App adds comments to Sentinel incidents and requires an Azure Logic App backend. See [mcp-apps/sentinel-incident-comment/README.md](mcp-apps/sentinel-incident-comment/README.md) for full setup instructions.

Based on: [stefanpems/mcp-add-comment-to-sentinel-incident](https://github.com/stefanpems/mcp-add-comment-to-sentinel-incident)

#### 2. Configure Environment

Edit `config.json` with your settings:

```json
{
  "sentinel_workspace_id": "YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID_HERE",
  "tenant_id": "your-azure-tenant-id",
  "ipinfo_token": "your-ipinfo-token",
  "abuseipdb_token": "your-abuseipdb-token-here",
  "vpnapi_token": "your-vpnapi-token-here",
  "output_dir": "reports"
}
```

**MCP Apps Configuration:**

> ⚠️ **VS Code Insiders Required:** MCP Apps currently require [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) to function. This feature will be available in the stable VS Code release soon, but for now, calling MCP Apps from the standard VS Code version is not supported.

Create or update `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace root to register the MCP App servers:

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "sentinel-webhook-url",
      "description": "Sentinel Incident Comment Webhook URL (Logic App)",
      "password": true
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "sentinel-geomap": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["${workspaceFolder}/mcp-apps/sentinel-geomap-server/dist/main.js", "--stdio"],
      "type": "stdio"
    },
    "sentinel-heatmap": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["${workspaceFolder}/mcp-apps/sentinel-heatmap-server/dist/main.js", "--stdio"],
      "type": "stdio"
    },
    "sentinel-incident-comment": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["${workspaceFolder}/mcp-apps/sentinel-incident-comment/dist/index.js", "--stdio"],
      "type": "stdio",
      "env": {
        "SENTINEL_COMMENT_WEBHOOK_URL": "${input:sentinel-webhook-url}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `${input:sentinel-webhook-url}` pattern securely prompts for the webhook URL when the MCP server starts, avoiding hardcoded secrets.

After adding this configuration, restart VS Code Insiders. Available tools:
- `mcp_sentinel-geom_show-attack-map` - Geographic attack visualization
- `mcp_sentinel-heat_show-signin-heatmap` - Time-based heatmap visualization
- `mcp_sentinel-inci_add_comment_to_sentinel_incident` - Add comments to Sentinel incidents

**Optional API Tokens:**
- **ipinfo.io** - Increases rate limit from 1,000/day to 50,000/month (free tier)
- **vpnapi.io** - VPN detection (included in ipinfo.io paid plans)
- **AbuseIPDB** - IP reputation scoring (free tier: 1,000/day)

## 💬 Working with Agent Skills

Skills are self-documenting workflows that Copilot loads automatically based on keywords in your prompts. Each skill contains:
- Specialized KQL queries and data collection steps
- Risk assessment criteria and severity thresholds
- Output formats (HTML reports, Markdown reports, visualizations)
- Follow-up analysis patterns

### Discovering Available Skills

**Ask Copilot what skills are available:**
```
What investigation skills do you have access to?
List all available skills in this workspace
What types of investigations can you perform?
```

**Get details about a specific skill:**
```
Explain the high-level workflow of the user-investigation skill
What does the incident-investigation skill do?
How does the authentication-tracing skill work?
What data sources does the ioc-investigation skill use?
```

### Triggering Skills with Natural Language

Skills are automatically detected based on keywords. You don't need to mention the skill name:

| What you say | Skill triggered |
|--------------|-----------------|
| "Investigate user@domain.com for the last 7 days" | user-investigation |
| "Analyze incident 12345" | incident-investigation |
| "Is this IP malicious? 203.0.113.42" | ioc-investigation |
| "Check the device WORKSTATION-01 for threats" | computer-investigation |
| "Show attack patterns on a heatmap" | heatmap-visualization |
| "Map the geographic origins of these attacks" | geomap-visualization |
| "Write a KQL query to find failed sign-ins" | kql-query-authoring |
| "Trace this authentication back to the original MFA" | authentication-tracing |
| "Detect scope drift in service principals over the last 90 days" | scope-drift-detection |
| "Run a user drift analysis for user@domain.com" | scope-drift-detection |

### Following Up on Investigations

After running an investigation, you can ask follow-up questions without re-running the entire workflow:

```
Is that IP a VPN?
What's the abuse score for the Hong Kong IP?
Trace authentication for that suspicious location
Show me details about that risk detection
Was MFA used for those sign-ins?
```

Copilot uses existing investigation data from `temp/investigation_*.json` when available.

### Combining Skills

Skills can be chained together for comprehensive analysis:

```
1. "Investigate incident 12345" → incident-investigation extracts entities
2. "Now investigate the user from that incident" → user-investigation runs on extracted UPN
3. "Check if that IP is malicious" → ioc-investigation analyzes the suspicious IP
4. "Show me a heatmap of the attack patterns" → heatmap-visualization
```

### Understanding Skill Output

**Ask about results after an investigation:**
```
Summarize the key findings from that investigation
What are the critical actions I should take?
Explain the risk assessment
What would you recommend for next steps?
```

**Request different output formats:**
```
Generate an HTML report for that user investigation
Create a markdown summary of the incident
Show the attack origins on a world map
```

### Setup Verification

After installing the MCP servers, verify they're working:

```powershell
# Test Sentinel MCP (Required)
mcp_sentinel-mcp-2_list_sentinel_workspaces()
# Expected: Array with your workspace name/ID

# Test Graph MCP (Required)
mcp_microsoft_mcp_microsoft_graph_get("/v1.0/me?$select=displayName")
# Expected: JSON with your display name

# Test Sentinel Triage MCP (Required for honeypot investigations)
mcp_sentinel-tria_FetchAdvancedHuntingTablesOverview({"tableNames": ["DeviceInfo"]})
# Expected: Schema information for DeviceInfo table

# Test KQL Search MCP (Required for KQL authoring)
mcp_kql-search_get_schema_statistics()
# Expected: Statistics showing 331+ tables indexed

# Test Microsoft Learn MCP (Required for KQL authoring)
mcp_microsoft-lea_microsoft_docs_search({"query": "KQL query language"})
# Expected: Search results from Microsoft Learn
```

**Authentication:**
- All MCP servers handle Azure AD authentication automatically
- Use service principals with certificate auth for production (not interactive auth)
- Configure authentication tokens in VS Code MCP server settings

**Configuration:**
- MCP servers must be configured in VS Code settings (see installation guides above)
- Default workspace ID from `config.json` used if not specified in Sentinel queries
- Graph API calls require explicit endpoint paths (use `suggest_queries` to discover)

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### config.json

```json
{
  "sentinel_workspace_id": "YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID_HERE",
  "tenant_id": "your-azure-tenant-id",
  "ipinfo_token": "your-ipinfo-token-here",
  "abuseipdb_token": "your-abuseipdb-token-here",
  "vpnapi_token": "your-vpnapi-token-here",
  "output_dir": "reports"
}
```

### Configuration Options:

| Setting | Description | Required | Default |
|---------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `sentinel_workspace_id` | Microsoft Sentinel (Log Analytics) workspace GUID | Yes | None |
| `tenant_id` | Azure AD tenant ID for authentication context | No | Auto-detected from auth |
| `ipinfo_token` | ipinfo.io API token (increases rate limits to 50K/month, includes VPN detection in paid tier) | No | None (1K/day free) |
| `abuseipdb_token` | AbuseIPDB API token for IP reputation scoring (0-100 abuse confidence score) | No | None (1K/day free) |
| `vpnapi_token` | vpnapi.io API token for VPN/proxy/Tor detection (standalone service) | No | None (free tier available) |
| `output_dir` | Directory for generated HTML reports | No | `reports` |

### API Rate Limits (IP Enrichment):

**Without tokens (free tier):**
- **ipinfo.io**: 1,000 requests/day (geolocation, org, ASN only)
- **AbuseIPDB**: 1,000 requests/day (IP reputation scoring)
- **vpnapi.io**: 1,000 requests/month free tier (VPN/proxy detection)

**With tokens (recommended for production):**
- **ipinfo.io**: 50,000 requests/month (free tier) or unlimited (paid plans starting at $249/month - includes VPN detection)
- **AbuseIPDB**: 1,000 requests/day (free) or 10,000/day (paid plans starting at $20/month)
- **vpnapi.io**: 10,000 requests/month ($9.99/month) or 100,000/month ($49.99/month)

**Token Priority:**
- If `ipinfo_token` is a **paid plan**, VPN detection is included → `vpnapi_token` is optional
- If `ipinfo_token` is **free tier**, use `vpnapi_token` for VPN detection
- `abuseipdb_token` is always used independently for reputation scoring

**IP enrichment happens during report generation** (not data collection), so you can generate reports multiple times without re-querying Sentinel/Graph.

---

## 📦 Dependencies

Core Python packages:
- **requests** - HTTP client for IP enrichment APIs (ipinfo.io, vpnapi.io, AbuseIPDB)
- **python-dateutil** - Date parsing and manipulation for KQL time ranges

Install with:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Optional:**
- **ipykernel** - Jupyter notebook support (for testing/development)
- **pylance** - Python language server (VS Code extension)

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Confidential Data** - All investigation reports contain PII and sensitive security data
   - Mark reports as CONFIDENTIAL
   - Store in secure file shares with access control
   - Follow organizational data classification policies
   - Reports include automatic confidentiality header with generator name/machine/timestamp

2. **Access Control** - Restrict access to investigation tools to authorized SOC personnel
   - Implement Azure RBAC for Sentinel workspace access
   - Use PIM (Privileged Identity Management) for Graph API permissions
   - Log all investigation executions for audit trail

3. **Audit Trail** - All investigations are timestamped and logged
   - JSON files in temp/ directory preserve investigation snapshots
   - HTML reports include generation metadata (user, machine, timestamp)
   - MCP server calls are logged in VS Code telemetry

4. **Data Retention** - Follow organizational policies for report storage
   - Automated cleanup: Investigations older than 3 days are auto-deleted (configurable)
   - Archive important investigations before cleanup
   - Consider long-term retention for compliance/forensics

5. **MCP Permissions** - Ensure MCP servers have appropriate RBAC permissions
   - Sentinel: Log Analytics Reader (minimum), Sentinel Contributor (for watchlists)
   - Graph API: User.Read.All, UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All, Device.Read.All, IdentityRiskEvent.Read.All
   - Use service principals with certificate auth (not interactive auth)

6. **API Token Security** - Store API tokens securely
   - Never commit config.json with tokens to Git (already in .gitignore)
   - Use environment variables or Azure Key Vault for production deployments
   - Rotate tokens regularly (ipinfo.io, AbuseIPDB)

7. **Investigation JSON Files** - Contain complete investigation data
   - Stored in temp/ directory (not committed to Git)
   - Include IP enrichment data (VPN status, abuse scores, threat intel)
   - Can be re-analyzed without re-querying Sentinel/Graph

**Reports are marked CONFIDENTIAL and should be handled according to organizational security policies.**

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"No anomalies found" error** | The `Signinlogs_Anomalies_KQL_CL` table doesn't exist or has no data. See the user-investigation skill documentation for KQL job setup. Wait 24 hours for initial data population. |
| **"Import could not be resolved" (Pylance warning)** | This is a false positive from Pylance type checking. The code will run correctly. Ignore or disable Pylance warnings. |
| **"IP enrichment failed"** | ipinfo.io rate limits (1,000/day free tier). Add API token to `config.json` for 50,000/month. Or wait for rate limit reset (midnight UTC). |
| **"MCP server not available"** | MCP servers must be installed and configured in VS Code. Check VS Code settings → Extensions → MCP Server Configuration. Verify authentication tokens are valid. |
| **"User ID not found" in Graph API** | User may not exist, or Graph API permissions missing. Verify UPN is correct. Check Graph API permissions: User.Read.All, UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All. |
| **"Sentinel query timeout"** | Date range too large or table has too much data. Reduce date range (e.g., 7 days → 1 day). Add `| take 10` to limit results during testing. |
| **Missing device `trustType` or `approximateLastSignInDateTime`** | Use default values in JSON export: `trustType="Workplace"`, `approximateLastSignInDateTime="2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"`. Report generator handles nulls gracefully. |
| **Report generation fails** | Check JSON file has ALL required fields (see copilot-instructions.md for schema). Validate JSON syntax with `python -m json.tool temp/investigation_*.json`. |
| **Empty sections in report (Office 365, Audit Logs)** | Normal if user has no activity in that timeframe. Reports now show green "✓ No [X] detected" messages consistently. |
| **SecurityIncident query returns no results** | Ensure you're using BOTH `targetUPN` and `targetUserId` (Azure AD Object ID) in the query. Some incidents use Object ID instead of UPN. |
| **Risky sign-ins query fails with 404** | Must use `/beta` endpoint, not `/v1.0`. Graph API: `/beta/auditLogs/signIns?$filter=...` |

### Verification Steps

**1. Verify Graph API Permissions:**
```powershell
# Test user query
mcp_microsoft_mcp_microsoft_graph_get("/v1.0/users/user@domain.com?$select=id,displayName")
```
**Expected:** JSON response with user ID and display name

**2. Verify Sentinel Connectivity:**
```powershell
# Test workspace query
mcp_sentinel-mcp-2_list_sentinel_workspaces()
```
**Expected:** Array with workspace name/ID pairs

**3. Verify IP Enrichment:**
```powershell
python enrich_ips.py 8.8.8.8
```
**Expected:** JSON with city, region, country, org, ASN, is_vpn, abuse_confidence_score

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging in `generate_report_from_json.py`:
```python
# Add at top of file
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## ‍💻 Contributing

This system is designed to be extended and customized for your organization's specific needs.

### Add Custom Risk Factors

Edit risk assessment logic in `report_generator.py` (search for `_assess_risk`):

```python
# Example: Flag non-VPN remote access as high risk
if 'VPN' not in ip_intel.org and ip_intel.country != 'US':
    risk_factors.append("Non-VPN international access detected")
    risk_score += 3
```

### Customize Report Styling

Edit `_get_styles()` in `report_generator.py`:

```python
# Change primary brand colors
:root {
    --primary-blue: #your-color;
    --critical-red: #your-color;
    --success-green: #your-color;
}
```

### Add New KQL Queries

Add to copilot-instructions.md Sample KQL Queries section:

1. Write and test query in Sentinel
2. Document in copilot-instructions.md with clear purpose
3. Add to parallel batch (Batch 1, 2, or 3)
4. Update JSON export structure in copilot-instructions.md
5. Update report generator to display new data

### Extend IP Enrichment

Edit `generate_report_from_json.py` to add new enrichment sources:

```python
# Example: Add custom threat feed lookup
threat_feed_url = f"https://your-threat-feed.com/api/check/{ip}"
response = requests.get(threat_feed_url)
ip_data['custom_threat_intel'] = response.json()
```

### Custom Anomaly Rules

Modify the KQL job in Sentinel (see `docs/Signinlogs_Anomalies_KQL_CL.md`):

```kql
// Example: Add custom anomaly type for weekend sign-ins
| extend IsWeekend = dayofweek(TimeGenerated) in (0, 6)  // Sunday=0, Saturday=6
| where IsWeekend
| extend AnomalyType = "WeekendActivity"
```
